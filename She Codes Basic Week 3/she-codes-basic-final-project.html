      <p>
        There’s a reason why everyone seems to have a camera these days. And
        while people can sometimes go a little overboard, documenting every
        moment for social media, the truth remains: photography is a truly
        fulfilling hobby. Even if you never earn a cent from your pictures,
        taking up photography as a hobby can bring a lot of joy to your life.
        Though there are countless reasons why photography is an awesome hobby,
        here are our top 11 to inspire you to pick up a camera today.
      </p>

      <p>
        And once you pick up your camera and feel like heading out there, why
        not book a
        <span>Peerspace</span> venue for practice? We are the most extensive
        digital marketplace for all things pertaining to bookable venues. From
        delightful yurts in the desert to sky-high penthouses in the urban
        jungle, we offer access to the photogenic venues that will inspire your
        next project and beautify your portfolio!
      </p>

      <p>But first, let’s get back to the topic at hand!</p>

      <h2>1. Photography as a hobby gets you active</h2>

      <img
        alt="Open Space"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/philadelphia-graffiti-warehouse.webp"
      />

      </div>

      <p>
        If you’ve ever gone for a walk and found yourself staring down at your
        smartphone the whole time, you know how hard it can be to pay attention
        to the world around you. Having an activity to do while you’re out and
        about can help you be more present and aware of your surroundings. Give
        yourself a mission while you’re outdoors, such as taking pictures of
        street art or birdlife. This way, getting your daily exercise will have
        a purpose and won’t seem like a chore.
      </p>

      <h2>2. It exercises your brain</h2>
      <img
        alt="Architect"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/Downtown-Rooftop-Deck-with-Spectacular-Skyline-View.webp"
      />

      <div>
        <a href="https://www.peerspace.com" target="_blank"
          >Source: Peerspace</a
        >
      </div>

      <p>
        You don’t have to be an expert to enjoy photography as a hobby. In fact,
        cameras are so easy to use these days that you probably won’t need any
        training at all. But if you want to improve your skills, there’s
        <em>always</em>
        more to learn. You can try tilt-shift photography, underwater
        photography, skyline photography, and more. Switch your camera from
        “auto” to “manual” mode and have fun seeing how many new tricks you can
        discover.
      </p>

      <h2>3. It’s affordable</h2>
      <img
        alt="Bright Room"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/portland-cyc-wall-studio-1.webp"
      />

      </div>

      <p>
        Some hobbies require a lot of equipment, but cameras are cheaper than
        ever. A few decades ago, being a photographer meant having to buy your
        film stock and gain access to a dark room to develop your own photos.
        These days, you already have a camera on your smartphone. If you
        <em>do</em> want to use more expensive gear or don’t want to take your
        DSLR with you when you travel, you can always rent gear from a fellow
        photographer on <em>KitSplit</em> or book a studio for the day on
        <span>Peerspace</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>4. You can document your life</h2>
      <img
        alt="Restaurant"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/boston-winery-eatery-1.webp"
      />

      </div>

      <p>
        It’s easy to immortalize your life through photography, whether it’s
        creating a scrapbook of your travels or taking a
        <em>picture of yourself</em>
        every day for a year. Look back through your photos to be reminded of
        where you’ve been throughout the year, whom you spent time with, and
        even what meals you cooked! Send photos to your long-distance friends
        and family to keep them in the loop, or post the images on social media
        if you want to build a personal following.
      </p>

      <h2>5. You can document the world around you</h2>
      <img
        alt="Gallery"

      </div>

      <p>
        Photographs can change the world, and an image can go viral in an
        instant. Whether you’re a street photographer documenting protests in
        Washington, DC, or a wildlife photographer taking photographs of
        habitats affected by climate change, you never know when your photo will
        make a difference. Your images can help people see the world in a new
        way. Check out the
        <strong>Female Farmer Project</strong> or
        <strong>Lensational</strong> to get inspired.
      </p>

      <h2>6. You’ll meet new people</h2>
      <img
        alt="Luxury Woman"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/nyc-royal-velvet-baroque-luxury-1.webp"
      />

      <div>
        <a href="https://www.peerspace.com" target="_blank"
          >Source: Peerspace</a
        >
      </div>

      <p>
        Photography might seem like a solo hobby, but there are plenty of
        opportunities to meet people. From joining photography groups on
        <strong>Meetup</strong> to finding models to work with on
        <strong>ModelMayhem</strong>, you don’t have to do everything yourself.
        These days, most photographers have accounts on Instagram, so if you’re
        looking to collaborate with other people, that’s an excellent place to
        start. Just be respectful and aware that many models will expect payment
        for their time.
      </p>

      <h2>7. You can do it anywhere</h2>
      <img
        alt="Outside"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/los-angeles-sweeping-ocean-mountain-views-home.webp"
      />

      </div>

      <p>
        Taking a guitar on an airplane with you is a hassle. Painting can make a
        mess. But cameras are portable, and you don’t need any unique talents or
        physical abilities. You can take photos from the passenger seat of a car
        or the comfort of your own studio. You can even get a drone and take
        incredible aerial shots without much effort.
      </p>

      <h2>8. It’s instant gratification</h2>
      <img
        alt="Living Room"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/studio-city-dreamy-pink-and-green-room-los-angeles-rental.webp"
      />

      <div>
        <a href="https://www.peerspace.com" target="_blank"
          >Source: Peerspace</a
        >
      </div>

      <p>
        Sure, you might do some touching up in Photoshop or throw on an
        Instagram filter. But for the most part, what you see is what you get.
        You don’t have to wait for the paint to dry or your prints to come in
        the mail. If something doesn’t work, you can try again until you get it
        right.
      </p>

      <h2>9. You can earn passive income</h2>
      <img
        alt="Loft"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/san-diego-industrial-loft-gaslamp-1.webp"
      />

        >
      </div>

      <p>
        You don’t have to be a professional photographer to make money from your
        work. Even if you only treat photography as a hobby, you can earn a
        little extra income from stock photo platforms like
        <strong>Shutterstock</strong> and <strong>Twenty20</strong>. Don’t
        expect to make lots of money unless you have a lot of photos, but you’ll
        earn a small percentage every time someone licenses your work. And if
        your hobby becomes your full-fledged career, you’ll likely set up your
        own photo studio. If so, you can earn even more passive income by
        listing it on <span>Peerspace</span>. As a Peerspace host, you set the
        rules while giving other photographers access to a clean, safe, and
        inspiring venue.
      </p>

      <h2>10. It’s safe</h2>
      <img
        alt="Coffee Shop"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/atlanta-light-filled-coffee-shop-cafe-refuge.webp"
      />

      </div>

      <p>
        You might not think of hobbies as being particularly dangerous, but even
        taking up sports can leave you with a broken leg. Unless you’re taking
        selfies with polar bears, you probably won’t get hurt if you take up
        photography as a hobby. There are no heavy objects, sharp edges, or
        flammable materials to worry about, except maybe your studio lights. If
        you’re worried about dropping or damaging equipment, you can always get
        insurance.
      </p>

      <h2>11. You can combine it with other hobbies</h2>
      <img
        alt="Sunset"
        src="https://www.peerspace.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/yurt-pioneertown-joshua-tree-national-park-yucca-valley-rental-1.webp"

      <p>
        Photography is ideal for people with many interests, as you can mix and
        match it with pretty much any other hobby out there. You can photograph
        trains, animals, antique cars, stars, people, food, architecture – the
        list is endless. If you’re interested in astronomy, learn to take photos
        of the moon. If you like to scuba dive, you can practice underwater
        photography.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best of all, you can use the
        <em>same camera</em> for most of these hobbies. Just switch lenses, and
        you can move from one type of photography to another. Photography is an
        excellent complement to other crafts as well, such as writing or music.
        You can use your photography to illustrate your memoir or design your
        own album cover. It’s a great stepping stone to videography, too.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope you’ll agree that taking up photography as a hobby is an
        exciting choice. With a low barrier to entry and so many ways to get
        started, there’s no reason not to give it a try. And remember to book an
        inspiring
        <span>Peerspace</span> venue near you to practice all the skills you
        learn along the way. Pick up your smartphone — or grab an old Nikon —
        and start taking your own photographs today.
